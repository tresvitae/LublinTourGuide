Google&amp;Udacity Android Basics Scholarship - Tour Guide App

The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. The App includes:
- Planning app design and navigation before coding
- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
- Building layouts to display those lists of data
- Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout and Navigation Drawer
- Creating own custom classes- 
- Properly handling images

This app was created as part of the Android Basics Nanodegree Program by Google course. This is the "Tour Guide App" (v3).
